### Running

Run with example stdin input:
```bash
$ java src/main/java/com/jonssonhector/aoc/Runner.java <day> <input>
```

with `<day>` being the day you want to run. And `<input>` as the input for the day.
Omit the `<input>` to run with the actual puzzle input contained in the resources' folder.
